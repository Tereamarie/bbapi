# Bob's Burgers API

I wanted to practice building an API with Phoenix. Inspired by
https://swapi.com, I decided to make my API based off Bob's Burgers. I will also
use this opportunity to use GraphQL with Absinthe. I attended a talk about it at
ElixirConf and bought a book from PragProg, so this would be a great chance to
give it a go.
