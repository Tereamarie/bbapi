# Bob's Burgers API

Inspired by https://swapi.co, I decided to make my own API using Phoenix. This
would be a good reason to expand my knowledge of Phoenix and have some fun in
the process. I decided to use Bob's Burgers because the show is hilarious and
awesome. It also has the added benefit of hopefully not being too complicated of
a show to round up all the needed data.
